# crypto_wallet_tracker
This bot was originally used to track influencers wallet addresses and front run their transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

This code is released for education purposes. 


Haven't tested this modified version but the main code is here for you to figure out how to run it (you can test with your own ETH-20 wallet).
